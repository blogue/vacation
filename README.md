#### By _**{Benjamin Logue}**_

## Description

_{User is prompted to answer six questions and submit their form. The application then takes the values for the radio buttons, adds one to a counter variable for each specific destination that the answer is associated with, and then finds the max value of the counter, and uses a function to find the position of that value in an array. The array position with the max value is then ran through an 'if/else if' statement to redirect the user to the appropriate page results. }_
